A historic building has so many related episodes. Some could be a venue for important decisions, some could be a place for murder. If we go a building, we can easily think about its episodes, i.e., history.

Under these episodes, there should be so many events or reasons for some actions, etc... Knowing these things, we can think about the people related and why they acted like they acted. In other words, we can learn about the connection among the facts, events, and people's feelings.

Some think that modern buildings earn more money than old historic ones. Maybe it's true.
If you think about only money, replacing old ones with new ones must be best choice. But can modern building give us a chance to think about old events and chance to feel like people who related old building? The answer is NO.
