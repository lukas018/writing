Topic : A city should try to preserve its old, historic building rather than destroy them and replace them with modern buildings.

The issue here is wheter to preserve historic building or destroy them. In my opinion, I believe that replacing the old, historic building with the new modern building is better and my view can be greatly substaintiated by the reasons addressed below.

Firstly, replacement of old building create more jobs. In other words, replacing the old building will benefit society economy. For example, if we decide to destory the old building and replace it with the new building, we need to hire the one who can do that things. This eventually lead the economic growth.

Moreover, old building might cause accident. That is to say, old building is more dangerous. For instance, we can see many accident which is resulted from the fact that old building are weak. More recently, I heard a news that a man died because his house's roof is fall down and the latent cause of that accident was that the builing that the man lived was too old.

Finally, new modern building eventually increase the quality of life of humanity. The technology is now developing rapidly. And with the growth of technology, the architecture is also developing rapidly. This changes make the quality of builing more good. And I think it will make people's life more wonderful.

In conclusion, Iâ€™m definitely for the idea that people benefit more by replacing the old builging. I know that there are a lot of people who disagree with my opinion. However, considering the three reasons I mentioned in the paragraphs above, I believe that replacement of old building brings more benefits to a person than just preserve it.
